This project focuses on controlling two induction motors using Field-Oriented Control (FOC) with the help of a Texas Instruments DSP C2000. The development process began with a simulation of the FOC algorithm in MATLAB, which was then adjusted to be suitable for implementation on the C2000 hardware.

In addition to the basic FOC, the project integrates advanced control techniques such as the Ackermann model and torque vectoring. These methods are employed to enhance vehicle stability, particularly during turns, by adjusting the speed and torque of each wheel based on the steering angle and vehicle speed.

The project also includes the implementation of a sensorless FOC model using a Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS), allowing for precise motor control without the need for physical sensors.This project focuses on controlling two induction motors using Field-Oriented Control (FOC) with the help of a Texas Instruments DSP C2000.
